    "The effectiveness of an LLM is directly proportional to the clarity of your intent. Think of the model not as a mind-reader, but as a highly capable intern who lacks any prior context. If you give a vague \"dump of words,\" the model has to guess your goals—and it will often guess wrong.\n",
    "By being specific, you guide the model's focus, reduce \"hallucinations,\" and ensure the output matches your desired tone, format, and length. Remember: Specific doesn't always mean short. A longer prompt that provides clear guardrails is significantly more effective than a cryptic one-liner.\n",

Not everyone is lucky to represent their country’s colours. What’s more, he went on to play in 4 World Cups in this very format. He was also leading the pace attack in the 2021 World Cup edition where Australia were crowned champions.\n",

He took 79 wickets in 65 appearances in his 12-year-long T20 career, something no one will expect from a bowler of his stature. What remains out of sight is his collateral contribution. Imagine being 1-0 after an over in this dynamic format where 250+ runs are being scored for fun. It was the pressure that he built from one end that forced the errors on the other end. He was the shade that sheltered the likes of Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins, Jason Behrendorff, Andrew Tye, Daniel Sams and many more. Famous as a “first-over specialist”, he has taken 11 wickets in the very first over of innings.\n",
